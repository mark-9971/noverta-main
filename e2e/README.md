# Trellis end-to-end tests

Playwright suite that exercises critical first-run flows against a running
Trellis dev environment.

## What's covered

- `tests/sample-data-flow.spec.ts` — admin signs in, clicks "Try with
  sample data" on `/setup`, lands on `/compliance-risk-report` with
  non-empty content, sees the global `SampleDataBanner` across pages,
  then tears down and confirms counts return to zero.
- `tests/sample-data-tour.spec.ts` — admin seeds sample data and the
  guided `SampleDataTour` auto-opens on `/compliance-risk-report`. The
  test walks through all five steps, asserts the `data-tour-id` anchor
  for each step exists, then verifies that both "Finish" and "Skip
  tour" persist the seen flag and prevent the tour from re-appearing on
  reload while sample data is still loaded.

## Running locally

```bash
# 1. Install playwright browsers (first time only)
pnpm --filter @workspace/e2e exec playwright install chromium

# 2. Make sure the dev API + web are running (workflows: artifacts/api-server, artifacts/trellis).

# 3. Provide a Clerk test admin (see https://clerk.com/docs/testing/test-emails).
export E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL='trellis-e2e-admin+clerk_test@example.com'
export E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD='TrellisE2E!Test#2026'

# 4. Run.
pnpm --filter @workspace/e2e test
```

The suite uses `@clerk/testing` so `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` must be set in the environment (they already are in the
Replit dev env). The test resolves `baseURL` from `E2E_BASE_URL` →
`https://$REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN` → `http://localhost:80`.

In the Replit dev environment Clerk runs in test mode and `+clerk_test`
emails bypass email verification, so the suite can sign in
non-interactively against the same Clerk instance the app uses. The test
is self-cleaning: any leftover sample data from a prior run is removed
before the seed step.
