- `/imports/students` — POST bulk student import from CSV
- `/imports/service-requirements` — POST bulk IEP service requirement import from CSV
- `/imports/sessions` — POST bulk session log import from CSV

### Frontend Pages
- `/` — Dashboard with KPI cards, compliance ring gauge, session delivery bar chart, compliance by service progress bars, recent alerts
- `/students` — Student list with risk filter pills, search, progress rings per student, clickable cards linking to detail
- `/students/:id` — Student detail with per-service bar chart, service breakdown with mini progress rings, recent sessions table
- `/sessions` — Session log with pagination, status filter pills, search, Log Session modal (create)
- `/schedule` — Weekly grid/list toggle view of recurring schedule blocks, staff filter dropdown
- `/staff` — Staff directory with tabs (Clinicians, Paraeducators, Case Managers), utilization progress rings
- `/alerts` — Compliance alerts with severity filter pills, resolve actions, refresh/show-resolved toggles
- `/compliance` — Overall compliance ring gauge, stacked bar chart by service type, filterable requirements table with inline progress bars
- `/reports` — Tabs for Minute Summary, Missed Sessions, At-Risk Students with mini progress rings and status badges
- `/import` — Bulk CSV import page with drag-and-drop upload, data preview, template downloads (MinuteOps standard, Aspen X2, eSPED), import history, support for students/IEP requirements/session logs

### UI Components
- `ProgressRing` — Circular SVG progress indicator (configurable size, stroke, color, label)
- `MiniProgressRing` — Compact circular progress indicator for inline use
- `AppLayout` — Sidebar navigation with indigo accent, alert badge count, user profile

### Design System
- Background: `slate-50/80`
- Cards: white with subtle border
- Primary: indigo-600
- Status colors: emerald (on track), amber (slightly behind), orange (at risk), red (out of compliance), indigo (completed)
- Typography: Inter font, 13px body, 11px labels, 2xl headings
- Filter pills: rounded-full with `aria-pressed` for accessibility
- Icons: Lucide React

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-client-react exec tsc -p tsconfig.json` — rebuild API client type declarations
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server locally

## Demo Data

Database is seeded with realistic demo data:
- 50 students across grades 1-12
- 18 staff (3 BCBAs, 2 SLPs, 2 OTs, 1 PT, 2 counselors, 6 paras, 2 case managers)
- 186 IEP service requirements
- 2855 session logs
- 330 recurring schedule blocks
- 106 compliance alerts (68 critical, 38 high)
