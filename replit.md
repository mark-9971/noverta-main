# MinuteOps — SPED Service Delivery Operations Platform

## Overview

MinuteOps is a production-quality school special education and ABA service delivery operations platform. It serves BCBAs, special education coordinators, paraeducators, providers, and case managers with IEP service requirement tracking, scheduling, delivered-minute tracking, compliance/risk dashboards, alerts, and reports.

## Demo Data

Database is seeded with realistic demo data:
- 50 students across grades 1-12
- 18 staff (3 BCBAs, 2 SLPs, 2 OTs, 1 PT, 2 counselors, 6 paras, 2 case managers)
- 186 IEP service requirements
- 2855 session logs
- 330 recurring schedule blocks
- 106 compliance alerts (68 critical, 38 high)
- 24 behavior targets across 8 students (elopement, aggression, non-compliance, SIB, vocal stereotypy)
- 22 program targets across 8 students (receptive ID, tacting, hand washing, intraverbal, matching)
- 184 data collection sessions with behavior and program data spanning 6 weeks
