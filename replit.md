# Trellis — School Management & SPED Service Delivery Platform

## Overview

Trellis is a comprehensive school management platform that combines general education (classes, assignments, gradebook) with special education (IEP/ABA) compliance. It features role-based views for administrators, teachers, and students — all using the same platform, with special ed services layered on top for IEP students. Fully compliant with Massachusetts 603 CMR 28.00/46.00.

**Brand Identity:** Name "Trellis", tagline "Built to support.", deep green/emerald palette, Sprout icon (Lucide), organic but structured feel.

## User Preferences

I want iterative development and detailed explanations of your thought process. Ask clarifying questions before making major architectural changes or implementing complex features. Do not change the fundamental project structure or core technologies without explicit approval.

## System Architecture

Trellis is built as a monorepo using `pnpm` workspaces, with a distinct separation between frontend and backend.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, wouter.
- **Backend (API):** Express 5, Node.js 24.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Data Validation:** Zod.
- **API Generation:** Orval generates React Query hooks and Zod schemas from an OpenAPI 3.1 specification.

**Core Architectural Decisions:**

- **Modular Monorepo:** Organizes code into `artifacts/minuteops` (frontend), `artifacts/api-server` (backend), `lib/api-spec` (OpenAPI spec), and shared libraries for API clients, Zod schemas, and the database layer.
- **RESTful API Design:** Backend interactions are exposed via a REST API.
- **Role-Based Architecture:** Five user roles with distinct navigation, theming, and routing — `admin` (emerald, `/`), `sped_teacher` (purple, `/`), `gen_ed_teacher` (emerald, `/teacher`), `sped_student` (violet, `/sped-portal`), `gen_ed_student` (blue, `/portal`). Role switching via vertical list in sidebar. SPED Teacher reuses admin routes. Each role has a demo picker; SPED/gen ed student IDs are stored in separate localStorage keys.
- **Comprehensive Database Schema:** PostgreSQL database supports detailed tracking of districts, schools, students, staff, services, IEPs, compliance, ABA data, classes, assignments, submissions, grades, and announcements. Districts table (`districts`) with schools linked via `schools.districtId` FK.
- **UI/UX Design:** A modern, clean aesthetic using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. Role-based color theming (emerald=admin, purple=sped_teacher, emerald=gen_ed_teacher, violet=sped_student, blue=gen_ed_student). Features include `ProgressRing` components, role-aware `AppLayout`, and responsive design. Warm cream background (HSL 40 30% 97%), deep green primary (HSL 160 45% 35%).

**Database Schema (Gen Ed):**
- `classes` — courses with teacher, period, room, subject, grade level
- `class_enrollments` — student-class enrollment with status
- `grade_categories` — weighted grading categories per class (Homework, Quizzes, Tests, Projects, Participation)
- `assignments` — assignments with type, points, due date, category
- `submissions` — student submissions with grade, feedback, status
- `announcements` — class or school-wide announcements
- `teacher_observations` — teacher behavior observations (studentId, staffId, date, description, severity)
- `progress_note_contributions` — teacher progress report contributions (reportId, staffId, goalId, narrative)

**Role-Based Views:**
- **Admin:** Full access to compliance, special ed, gen ed, analytics. Sidebar organized by workflow priority: top-level (Dashboard, Students, Alerts), Service Delivery (Sessions, Schedule, Service Minutes), Clinical & IEP (Programs & Behaviors, IEP Suggestions, Restraint & Seclusion, IEP Search), Academics (Classes, Gradebook), Reports & Admin (District Overview, Analytics, Reports, Staff Directory, Data Import). Routes: `/`, `/students`, `/sessions`, `/classes`, `/gradebook`, `/district`, `/analytics`, etc.
- **Teacher:** Class management, gradebook, assignments, student roster, grading interface, IEP classroom view. Routes: `/teacher`, `/teacher/classes`, `/teacher/gradebook`, `/teacher/assignments`, `/teacher/classroom`, etc.
- **Student:** Dashboard with GPA/assignments, class list, assignment submission, grade transcript. Routes: `/portal`, `/portal/classes`, `/portal/assignments`, `/portal/grades`

**API Endpoints (Gen Ed):**
- `GET/POST /classes` — class CRUD
- `GET /classes/:id/roster` — class student list
- `POST /classes/:id/enroll` — enroll student
- `GET /classes/:id/assignments` — list assignments
- `POST /classes/:id/assignments` — create assignment (auto-creates submissions)
- `GET /assignments/:id/submissions` — list all submissions for grading
- `PUT /submissions/:id/grade` — grade a submission
- `GET /students/:id/grades-summary` — transcript with per-class grades and GPA
- `GET /classes/:id/gradebook` — full gradebook matrix (students × assignments)
- `GET /teacher/:id/dashboard` — teacher overview with pending grading
- `GET /student/:id/dashboard` — student overview with upcoming/recent

**Seed Data:**
- 8 teachers across Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies, Art, PE, Music, Computer Science
- 16 classes with grade-level enrollment
- 52 students enrolled in 4 core + 1-3 elective classes
